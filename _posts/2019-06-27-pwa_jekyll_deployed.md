I've just deployed [dumaurier/pwa_jekyll](https://github.com/dumaurier/pwa_jekyll), using its "Deploy to Netlify" feature.

It has CMS that I haven't gotten running... but I'm comfortable sifting through configuration files... We'll see how it goes.

I have been successful at building it locally, and editing a post.. that seems like a good sign...

I'll use this site for information around Agoric, Mark Miller, and Object Capabilities.
