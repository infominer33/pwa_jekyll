I'm quite intrigued by what I found to be sort of the lost history of Smart Contracts. A year ago, I couldn't find too many people who knew about this, but I found about the E-Rights smart contract language while researching a [basic introduction](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/2018/10/9/smart-contracts-uses-cases-dapps-icos) to the subject.

I came across:

* [lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5003#comment-94645](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5003#comment-94645) 
  * *A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform* (Vitaliks ANN post on lambda-the-ultimate)
    > Smart contracts and related languages have a long discussion history on LtU

I didn't understand why noone was talking about it, but I found someone who knew about it, and am just beginning to fall down this particular rabbit hole.
